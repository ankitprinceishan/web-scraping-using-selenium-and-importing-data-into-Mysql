        <h2>Importance of Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>Ecosystems play a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. Here are some key points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity</strong>: Ecosystems are home to a vast array of species, contributing to genetic diversity essential for resilience against environmental changes and diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem Services</strong>: They provide vital services including:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Provisioning Services</strong>: Food, water, timber, and medicinal resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulating Services</strong>: Climate regulation, water purification, and pollination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Services</strong>: Recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits that enhance our quality of life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Climate Regulation</strong>: Ecosystems like forests and oceans absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to regulate the climate.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Health</strong>: They contribute to soil formation and fertility, which are crucial for agricultural productivity and food security.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Cycle</strong>: Ecosystems influence the water cycle, maintaining groundwater levels and regulating water flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>: Many industries rely on healthy ecosystems, providing jobs and economic stability.</li>
        </ul>
